# Password-Generator

## Description

The objective of this assignment is to create a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am - 5pm). The functionality of the password generator is executed through JavaScript code. Edits and additons to the JavaScript code were made by myself in order to meet the acceptance criteria below.

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
